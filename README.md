Overview
------------------------------
This code base is a collection of all assignments and personal practice projects done using SQL on a Weber State Student Database. These files are meant to show what abilities I have in SQl as well as be used as a reference for future SQL projects. I am not the creator of any of the practice questions created in any file labeled with, but not limited to, "CS2550SQL0#". These questions belong to Drew Weidman of Weber State University for his CS2550 course.  I have obtained permission to post these to this repository as well as to edit them in any way that I wish.
